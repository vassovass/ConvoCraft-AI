## 📖 Project Genesis: From a Personal Problem to a Portfolio Piece

This project was born out of a real-world frustration. I was using Perplexity on WhatsApp to capture notes and ideas, but it often failed to provide a text transcript of our conversations. I needed a reliable way to turn those voice notes into text, so I decided to build a solution myself.

My journey began with the coding agent in Google AI Studio. I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly and accurately it scaffolded the initial application, creating a functional UI and the core transcription logic in a single shot. It effortlessly handled batch transcriptions of multiple files, even when the total size was well over 25MB. This experience challenged my previous assumption that older OpenAI models were superior for coding; Gemini proved to be incredibly fast and effective.

As the tool evolved, I moved the project to Cursor and hosted it on GitHub. My focus shifted to making the application more robust, secure, and feature-rich. I integrated CodeRabbit to perform automated code reviews, ensuring a high standard of quality. This project is not just a utility; it's a testament to the power of modern AI development tools and a showcase of my journey in building a secure, user-friendly application from the ground up.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Multi-Provider AI**: Seamlessly switch between Google Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Groq, or even your own custom endpoint.
- **Secure, Client-Side Storage**: Your API keys and settings are stored securely in your browser's local storage, never in code or on a server.
- **Versatile Transcription**: Transcribe a wide range of formats, including audio (`.opus`, `.mp3`), video (`.mp4`), images, and documents.
- **Flexible Data Export**:
  - **Save All Transcriptions**: Save all completed transcriptions to individual `.txt` files with a single click.
  - **Copy to Clipboard**: Easily copy individual transcriptions or the entire merged WhatsApp chat.
  - **Multiple Export Formats**: Export merged chats and AI analysis as `.txt`, `.html`, `.json`, or `.csv`.
  - **Customizable Save Location**: Choose a preferred default directory for your saved files, with a fallback to your browser's default downloads folder.
- **WhatsApp Chat Integration**:
  - Upload or paste WhatsApp chat exports (`.txt`).
  - Automatically merge transcribed audio back into the chat timeline.

  - Leverage one-click prompts for summaries, key points, and sentiment analysis.
  - Write your own custom prompts to tailor the AI's analysis to your needs.
- **Auto-Saving Settings**: All changes made in the settings are saved automatically, providing a seamless user experience.
- **Smart Port Management**: The backend proxy detects if the default port is busy and auto-selects the next free port.
- **CLI Key Verifier**: Run `npm run verify:key` to confirm your `GEMINI_API_KEY` works end-to-end.
- **Private and Secure**: All processing happens in your browser. Your data is never sent to a third-party server, except for the AI provider you configure.
- **Open Source**: Licensed under the MIT license, so you can use, modify, and share it freely.

## 🔒 Security Features

Security is a top priority for ConvoCraft AI. Here's how we protect your data:

- **Client-Side API Keys**: API keys for providers like Gemini, OpenAI, etc., are stored exclusively in your browser's `localStorage`. They are never sent to the ConvoCraft backend server, ensuring they remain under your control. The backend only facilitates the connection, it does not handle your keys.
- **Content Sanitization**: All AI-generated content is sanitized using DOMPurify before being rendered in the browser. This prevents Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks and ensures that any potentially malicious content is neutralized.
- **Dependency Scanning**: We use automated tools to scan for vulnerabilities in our dependencies, ensuring the project stays secure.
- **Robust Launcher**: The `start-dev.bat` script provides a secure, interactive command-line interface that cleans up previous sessions, verifies system environment, and launches all services in the correct order.

## ⚙️ How the WhatsApp Merger Works: A Closer Look

The real magic of ConvoCraft AI is in its ability to seamlessly weave your transcribed audio back into the context of your WhatsApp conversations. This process is highly tailored to the specific format of WhatsApp's `.txt` chat exports.

**The Logic:**

1. **Identifying Audio Placeholders**: When you export a WhatsApp chat, audio messages are represented by a placeholder line that looks something like this:

    ```
    [2024/07/26, 10:30:15] Vasso: PTT-20240726-WA0001.opus (file attached)
    ```

    Our parser specifically looks for this pattern: a timestamp, a sender, a filename (like `PTT-20240726-WA0001.opus` or `AUD-20240726-WA0001.opus`), and the text `(file attached)`.

2. **Matching Transcriptions**: When you upload your `.opus` audio files for transcription, the app stores the transcribed text mapped to its original filename (e.g., `PTT-20240726-WA0001`).

3. **Replacing the Placeholder**: The merger then reads through your chat log line by line. When it finds an audio placeholder, it looks up the corresponding filename in its map of transcriptions. If a match is found, it replaces the entire placeholder line with the actual transcribed text, while keeping the original timestamp and sender:
    - **Before**: `[2024/07/26, 10:30:15] Vasso: PTT-20240726-WA0001.opus (file attached)`
    - **After**: `[2024/07/26, 10:30:15] Vasso: PTT-20240726-WA0001: Hello, this is the transcribed audio message. (file transcribed)`

**Important Note**: This feature is highly optimized for the official WhatsApp `.txt` export format. While it may work with other chat exports that follow a similar pattern, it is not guaranteed.

## 🤖 Choosing an AI for Transcription

While ConvoCraft AI supports multiple AI providers, it's important to understand that not all models are created equal, especially when it comes to audio transcription. For the best results, you should use a model that is specialized for this task.

- **Google Gemini**: The current implementation uses Gemini, which is a powerful multimodal model capable of handling audio, images, and video. It's a great general-purpose choice and is well-integrated into this application.
- **OpenAI's Whisper**: Whisper is a state-of-the-art model specifically designed for audio transcription. If your primary goal is the highest possible accuracy for audio files, you may want to configure the app to use OpenAI and its Whisper model.
- **Other Providers**: Other providers like Anthropic's Claude and Groq also have powerful models, but you should verify their transcription capabilities and pricing to see if they fit your needs.

**Recommendation**: Start with the built-in Gemini integration. If you find you need higher accuracy for audio, we recommend setting up an OpenAI key and using it as your active provider. Ultimately, the choice is yours, and we encourage you to research which provider offers the best balance of performance and cost for your use case.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm
- Windows operating system (for the automated launcher script)

> **Note on Platform Compatibility**: The `start-dev.bat` launcher script is designed for the Windows command-line environment. However, the core application itself is cross-platform. If you are on macOS or Linux, you can still run the project by following the [Manual Startup](#manual-startup-alternative) instructions.

### Installation & Running the App

The recommended way to run ConvoCraft AI on Windows is by using the interactive launcher script.

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/convocraft-ai.git
    cd convocraft-ai
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up your API key**:
    - Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project.
    - Add your Gemini API key to this file:
      ```
      GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
      ```
    - The `.env` file is listed in `.gitignore`, so your key will never be committed to source control.

4.  **Launch the application**:
    - Simply run the `start-dev.bat` file from your terminal or double-click it in your file explorer.
    - The script will guide you through the rest, including API key verification, checking for running servers, and launching the application in new, persistent command windows.

### Manual Startup (Alternative)

If you are not on Windows or prefer to run the services manually:

-   **Run the server**:
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```
-   **(Optional) Verify your Gemini key works**:
    ```bash
    npm run verify-gemini-key
    ```
-   **Run the client**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
